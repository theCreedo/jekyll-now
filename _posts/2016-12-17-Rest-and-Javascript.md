title: Rest and JavaScript
---

What did you do this past week?
------

This past week, I got lots of rest. I did 5 days worth of [JavaScript30 Challenge](https://javascript30.com), as well as planned out some side projects with other people.

For one of the projects, I'm working with a group for social dance in order to create an app that can help facilitate activities. We are thinking of having a microservices design, but I don't completely see how we will bring our app up to a scalable position, since we only plan to use it within our group. For social dance, one of the most important things we need to do is schedule songs depending on the particular song's dance type (ex. East Coast Swing, West Coast Swing, Salsa, etc...). If we can have an automated process, or have an interface in order to easily do that, then that would be highly beneficial.

Another important thing we decide to do is the roles the social dance leaders will have throughout a given dance/session. We have roles for people who give tape nametags to others and welcome people, an official DJ'ist in order to schedule appropriate songs, and the leaders who will be teaching dances on a given day.

I for one think we will need to do a lot of planning and designing before we can even start working on the Application. Additionally, I'm pretty sure we'll only be able to get possibly 1-2 features down, given the little time we have over winter break. Nonetheless, I'm optimistic in our group, since I'm sure that we'll work hard to hash out a working app that can not only be used now, but even in the future for other Slosh leaders. 

Of course, not everything I did was work base. I started a kdrama called [Goblin: The Lonely & Great God](http://kdramacool.com/goblin-korean-drama-episode-1-english-sub). Like all kdramas, it's about a guy who is looking for the one girl who will solve all his problems, but complications occur, like grim reapers and ghosts and mean crazy aunts. Check it out if you ever have time :P

I also started a tv show called [The Genius](http://kshowonline.com/kshow/2206-[engsub]-the-genius-s1-full). It plays off like the manga/drama [Liar Game], where people are placed into a game where they're required to build teams, earn trust, and fight in psychological games in order to win, gaining the most money (though in Liar Game, there is also an incentive in order to avoid debt). 

Whatâ€™s in your way?

I tend to be slow in recovering exercise-wise. I can't do arduous exercise or else I end up enduring too much pain from overstressing my muscles. I hope that I won't potato too much over the break, and build up a healthy habit of running or cardio and building up my physique. After experiencing a very rough semester with little free time even to work on my physical health, I want to become more fit so I can perform and live life at the peak of my abilities.

Winter Break Impressions
------
Lots of fun, lots of rest, and lots of work planned out to do. All in all, this Winter Break is good. 

What will you do next week?
------
Hopefully start developing on some of the projects I have. I will continue to work on the Javascript 30 Challenge and look into possibly other things I can work on in my free time.

Also, I feel like I'm very spiritually lacking, so I am doing a social media/Youtube fast for the next several days and see how that turns out. I want to spend more time with God, but I find myself getting too distracted with apps such as Snapchat, Facebook, Youtube, etc... So taking this fast and taking the time to spend more time with God hopefully will help me refocus on Him, as well as possibly spend time thinking over what I think truly matters in my life.

Info of the Week
------
For one of my projects, out group is thinking of using microservices architecure as a design decision. For development projects, there are many design decisions that can be made. How a server will execute code, how communication within networks works, and how the user will interact with developer code will decide what structure/platform the developer must work on. Microservices is a design decision that involves creating services for users that are independent in nature: they can be deployed by themselves without having to depend on databases from other services. These services may call on other services in order to achive a certain task (so there may be some dependencies to factor in), but when a bug or error arises, it will only be sourced in one service, so a developer can easily focus on that independent service. There are many other things that microservices provide, such as scalability (since services can be deployed onto a server depending on need-base). You can read more about it [here](http://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html).
