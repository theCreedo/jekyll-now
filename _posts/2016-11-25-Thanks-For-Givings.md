title: Week Fourteen – Thanksgivings
---

What did you do this past week?
------
This past week, I finished busy work I had for my classes and taking time off to go home for the break. It was good to be able to see family after such a long time. I was planning to work my OS project and study for my OOP exam, but I decided to take a well-needed break. It's been a while being able to sleep more than 7 hours. (sleep, you have been missed).

I got to spend time with friends at my favorite local teahouse and chilling at my friend's and family's house. I even got to have a sleepover at my home, which I've never really hosted before... But still should work on my sleep schedule.

On the bright side, I got a new bike! Hopefully it won't get stolen, since it looks new. After losing my bike, I'm going to be extra careful with it now, with triple locks if possible (lol jk, I'll just double lock).

What’s in your way?
------
I have OS project always looming behind my back. I can either choose to ignore it, and worry about it once I get back to UT, in which I will inevitably spend a lot of time in the lab working on it, or I could focus on it now and try to finish it up with my team. Since most of them live in my city, we've met up once, but I don't know if we'll be meeting up again, or have our next meeting in the lab or remotely. We shall see...

OOP Class Impressions
------
Class is getting hard to follow. Because my sleeping schedule is a bit messed up, I end up dozing off in class, which is bad... sorry Downing. I'm hoping to be able to fix it (as I say always) and be bright awake when I go to class on Monday. Then I'll be able to absorb information at 100% awake-mode. Because of it, I am unable to give good impressions... But next week, the hope is I'll be able to!


What will you do next week?
------
I'll be preparing for my OOP exam and finish OS's Filesystem project. If I'm lucky, I'll be able to apply to some hackathons and get my sleep schedule fixed. Also, I plan to finish Kattis sometime this break. That way I'll get those much needed extra points that will be wiped out after the OOP exam... no biggie.

Tip of the Week
------
If you ever want to practice typing faster for code, there's this website called [typing.io](https://typing.io/lessons) that lets you practice standard languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, etc...). One of the biggest things in programming is being able to design correct code, but it's also good to be able to type code fast (unless you're already typing at 100 words per second... [cookies](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) to you). So practice makes perfect. Can't wait to hear you guys type up a "Good Bye World" program in less than a day!
