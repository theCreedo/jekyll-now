### More Information

Greetings!

I am a junior CS student, a UTCS blogger, and an aspiring entrepreneur. I am always very passionate about learning new things, and thrive in the hackathon environment as a back-end developer and manager. I hope to become a very influential person through writing, programming, and teaching, and I'm always looking for opportunities to make an impact for everyone, while having a little bit of fun with memes along the way.

Passions: Jesus, Software Development, Hackathons, Reading Blogs, Manga, Newsletters, Food
